The purpose of this project is to collect the URL of radio streams around the world into a .pls file (although .m3u is also possible I think).

You take this .pls file and add it into a player programme like music on console or whatever and then you can play the streams.

Example of how to find radio streams:
The easiest way is if you know the website of the radio station, and if that radio station is nice and puts the stream-URL somewhere on their website. Not all of them do this. If they don't put the stream-URL on their website they most likely have a way for you to play the radio stream through their website. Take for example, wbhm.org. You go there and you'll see that they have a javascript type thing where you can click a button and it will play the stream. We don't really need this, we simply need the stream. An easy way to find the stream is to open Chromium's developer console, switch to the networking tab, press record and then press the acutal button on the radio station's website to start the stream. You should need be able to tell which URL is the stream.
